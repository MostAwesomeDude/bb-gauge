# Steps

This article covers the uncomputable function BB. BB(n,k) is the maximum
number of steps taken by any n-state k-symbol halting Turing machine. As a
historically-important special case, BB(n,2) is [OEIS
A60843](https://oeis.org/A060843), also known as S(n).

## NQL

NQL always compiles to 2-symbol Turing machines.
