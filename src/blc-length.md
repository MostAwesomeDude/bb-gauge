# Length

This article covers the uncomputable function [OEIS
A333479](https://oeis.org/A333479), known as BB位. BB位(n) is the size of the
largest normal form of any normalizing closed lambda term of size n, where the
size of a term is its length when encoded in
[BLC](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Binary_lambda_calculus).

## Summary

The following diagram summarizes known values and problems relative to BB位.
